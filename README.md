## What is Nomad

Jcorp Nomad is an open-source offline media server designed for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser interface. Multiple users can access separate media streams simultaneously, all without internet access.

This project is compact, easy to modify, and includes optional 3D-printable hardware. Both firmware and web interface are fully open-source.

## Get a Nomad

### Build It Yourself (Recommended)

I strongly recommend building your own Nomad. It's not a very difficult project, if you can follow instructions and plug in a USB cable, you can do it. The parts are cheap, widely available, and the whole build takes under an hour. See Hardware Requirements and Quick Start below. If nothing else please check out the DIY option before purchasing. 

### Buy a Prebuilt

That said, I also won't say no to money. If you'd rather skip the DIY and get a ready-to-go unit, prebuilt Nomads are available at **[nomad.jcorptech.net](https://nomad.jcorptech.net)**.

Every Nomad, whether you build it or buy it, runs the same open-source firmware and web interface. When new features and updates are released, you can always flash the latest code yourself to stay up to date. This project isn't going anywhere.

## Hardware Compatibility

Nomad is built specifically for the **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version)**. Due to the number of low-level tricks used to squeeze this much functionality out of the hardware, it is difficult to get Nomad running on other boards.

There are a few community forks that target other ESP32 boards, but your mileage will vary. Now that Nomad is stable on Mk3, I plan to develop a **Nomad Lite** version with wider board compatibility, focused on basic streaming without all the advanced features.

---

## Hardware Requirements

- **Waveshare ESP32-S3 Dev Board (1.47" LCD version)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4ktB6oT)

- **FAT32 microSD card (16-64GB recommended)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/44tM1c4)

- **SD-Card Extender (optional, 3DP case compatible)**
  [Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/45IWIJz)

- **USB power source**
- **Optional:** 3D-printed enclosure (STL files included)

---

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Fat32Format or equivalent
- SquareLine Studio (optional, for UI editing)

---

## Quick Start

1. Flash ESP32-S3 firmware from `/firmware/`.
2. Format SD card as FAT32 and copy `/SD_Card_Template/` files.
3. Place media in `/Movies`, `/Shows`, `/Books`, `/Music`, `/Gallery`, `/Files`.
4. Insert SD card and power device via USB.
5. Connect to Wi-Fi `Jcorp_Nomad` with password: `password`.
6. Open the browser interface.
7. Click the gear icon → Library Index → **Full Scan Now**.
8. Monitor Admin Console for progress; scan may take minutes.
9. Return to Menu page and enjoy your media!

## Key Improvements

1. **Faster & More Reliable Indexing**
   - Non-blocking, background indexing for large libraries.
   - Safe on power loss; partial indexes remain intact.
   - Auto-updates changes; frontend detects updates automatically.

2. **Resume Functionality**
   - Movies and Shows track playback progress.
   - Options for **Play from Start** or **Resume**.
   - Menu displays last three movies/shows; mobile shows most recent.

3. **Dark Mode**
   - Toggleable across all pages from the menu.

4. **Admin Page**
   - Full device control: shutdown, restart, flash mode, Wi-Fi, RGB LEDs, brightness, credentials, indexing, and file management.
   - Safe shutdown option for SD card health.
   - Real-time system console feedback.

5. **Stability Improvements**
   - Fixed frontend NDJSON sync issues.
   - Crash recovery on large indexes.
   - Dynamic LCD brightness adjustment.
   - Streaming stability enhancements.

6. **Improved Library Support**
   - Supports deeper folder structures for Shows and Music.
   - Flexible organization; media files can be nested at any level.

## What's Next

**Nomad Lite** - A stripped-down version of Nomad with wider board compatibility, focused on core streaming features. Now that Mk3 is stable, this is the next priority.

**Nomad Manager** - A companion application for Nomad that integrates with Jellyfin to handle automated media downcoding and transfers. Keep your Nomad stocked and ready to go without manual file management.

**Gallion** - A larger-scale sibling to Nomad, built on more capable hardware. Gallion is designed to handle everything that couldn't fit on Nomad's current platform > ZIM file support, ROM emulation, 4k video, and expanded media compatibility across the board. The current version is [here](https://github.com/Jstudner/Gallion).

---

## Project Inspiration

Inspired by my experience running a Jellyfin server, I wanted a portable, low-cost solution for offline media streaming. Challenges with SBCs (Raspberry Pi, etc.) included high power usage, heat, and instability.

Nomad focuses on delivering:

- Offline access
- Wide device compatibility
- Simple frontend for media browsing and playback
- Multiple user support
- High customization potential

The ESP32-S3 provides enough performance to handle these requirements efficiently, in a pocket-sized form factor.
