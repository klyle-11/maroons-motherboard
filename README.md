## What is Nomad

Jcorp Nomad is an open-source offline media server designed for travel, remote work, classrooms, camping, and more. It runs entirely on an ESP32-S3, creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot, and serves media through a browser interface. Multiple users can access separate media streams simultaneously, all without internet access.  

This project is compact, easy to modify, and includes optional 3D-printable hardware. Both firmware and web interface are fully open-source.

## Project Inspiration

Inspired by my experience running a Jellyfin server, I wanted a portable, low-cost solution for offline media streaming. Challenges with SBCs (Raspberry Pi, etc.) included high power usage, heat, and instability.  

Nomad focuses on delivering:

- Offline access  
- Wide device compatibility
- Simple frontend for media browsing and playback 
- Multiple user support
- High customization potential

The ESP32-S3 provides enough performance to handle these requirements efficiently, in a pocket-sized form factor.

## Stability & Features Update

Nomad is now **stable** on the `main` branch with several new features and improvements.  

**Notable Updates:**

- **EPUB support:** works, though formatting is rough.  
- **Audiobooks:** MP3 format with basic resume tracking; minor bugs may occur.  
- **CBZ support:** experimental; files may load slowly.

## Key Improvements

1. **Faster & More Reliable Indexing**
   - Non-blocking, background indexing for large libraries.
   - Safe on power loss; partial indexes remain intact.
   - Auto-updates changes; frontend detects updates automatically.

2. **Resume Functionality**
   - Movies and Shows track playback progress.
   - Options for **Play from Start** or **Resume**.
   - Menu displays last three movies/shows; mobile shows most recent.

3. **Dark Mode**
   - Toggleable across all pages from the menu.
   - Minor visual bugs may exist depending on browser.

4. **Admin Page**
   - Full device control: shutdown, restart, flash mode, Wi-Fi, RGB LEDs, brightness, credentials, indexing, and file management.
   - Safe shutdown option for SD card health.
   - Real-time system console feedback.

5. **Stability Improvements**
   - Fixed frontend NDJSON sync issues.
   - Crash recovery on large indexes.
   - Dynamic LCD brightness adjustment.
   - Streaming stability enhancements.

6. **Improved Library Support**
   - Supports deeper folder structures for Shows and Music.
   - Flexible organization; media files can be nested at any level.
